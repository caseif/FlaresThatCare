		This is the official Flares That Care  website. We are a quarterly charity live stream supporting Child's Play charity. Our first event, held in December of 2014, raised $500, $200 over our original goal which was hit under the first quarter of the stream. We were blown away by the sheer kindness of the Team Fortress and Twitch communities. We hope our dedication to the second event will allow more people to know about our live stream and help out Child's Play.
		<br><br>
		Our second event is set to take place from Friday, March 13th at 12 PM PST until Sunday, March 15th at 12 AM PST. <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/flaresthatcare">Check out our Steam group</a> to check out what events will be happening during the stream and who will be attending.

		Our stream will be held <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/flaresthatcare">at this link</a>. Please follow to show your support and to know when we go live!
		<br><br>
		Our website isn't finished yet as this is all being done on a volunteer basis for charity, but we're doing our best.
