<p>Greetings, stranger. We won't waste time asking how you found this place (<a href="mailto:admin@caseif.net">though it would be helpful if you did
tell us</a>), but we're afraid we can't let you proceed any further. For you see, access to these particular electrons is forbidden by policy, and if
we were to let you through, well, the entire machine would collapse into utter anarchy. And thus, in order to prevent such chaos, we've
unconditionally barred your entry. However, we may be mistaken, and if this is so, then <a href="mailto:admin@caseif.net">you may request that policy
be rewritten</a>.</p>
