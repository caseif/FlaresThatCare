		<p>Flares that Care is a quarterly (4 times/year) charity livestream supporting Child's Play Charity founded by
		<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198158123097" target="_blank">B_RED</a> and
		<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198155316177" target="_blank">Snoven</a> in December of 2014. Our first event raised $500,
		far above our original goal of $300. Our second event will be held in March of 2015. Our hope is to raise $750 and dedicate as much time
		to preparing for it as possible, rather than the rushed 3 days of planning we had before our first event.</p>
		<p>Our second event is set to take place from Friday, March 13th at 12 PM PST until Sunday, March 15th at 12 AM PST.</p>
