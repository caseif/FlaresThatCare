		Flares that Care is a quarterly (4 times/year) charity livestream supporting Child's Play Charity founded by B_RED and Snoven in December of
		2014. Our first event raised $500, way above our original goal of $300. Our second event will be held in March of 2015. Our hope is to raise
		$750 and dedicate as much time into it, rather than the rushed 3 days of planning we had before our first event. 
		<br><br>
		Our second event is set to take place from Friday, March 13th at 12 PM PST until Sunday, March 15th at 12 AM PST.

		Our stream will be held <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/flaresthatcare">at this link</a>. Please follow to show your support and to know when we
		go live!

		Our website isn't finished yet as this is all being done on a volunteer basis for charity, but we're doing our best.
